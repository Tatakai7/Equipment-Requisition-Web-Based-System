This system allows employees to request equipment through a digital process, eliminating the need to do it on paper or in person. There are two types of users in the system: admins and regular users.

The ADMIN PAGE allows admins to add or remove users/employees, and to accept or decline user requests.

## Usage

Those templates dependencies are maintained via [pnpm](https://pnpm.io) via `pnpm up -Lri`.

This is the reason you see a `pnpm-lock.yaml`. That being said, any package manager will work. This file can be safely be removed once you clone a template.

```bash
$ npm install # or pnpm install or yarn install
```
